# ROS chapter 5: simulation

# Simulation is all about random generating random numbers.
# Let's first wrap up some basics of random number generation

# Random numbers ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Random sampling from a uniform distribution
# (within a given range, every number is equally likely)

# A single random number between 0 and 1 (repeated to show that each
#  consecutive number is different from the previous numbers)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)

# For reproducibility we need to set the seed ('starting value')
set.seed(12345)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
# To repeat the previous sequence of three, reset the seed
set.seed(12345)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)

# We can use other ranges than 0-1
runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 100)
runif(n = 1, min = 10, max = 20)
runif(n = 1, min = -2, max = 2)

# We can generate any quantity of random numbers, e.g. 12 random numbers
#   between 0 and 100
set.seed(12345)
runif(n = 12, min = 0, max = 100)
# If we wanted just whole numbers, we can truncate them
set.seed(12345)
runif(n = 12, min = 0, max = 100) |> 
  trunc()

# The range can be very large if needed
runif(n = 12, min = -10000000, max = 10000000)

# Binomial distribution: How many successes in [size] trials where each
#    trial has a [prob] probability of success?

rbinom(n = 1, size = 10, prob = .50)
rbinom(n = 1, size = 10, prob = .50)
rbinom(n = 1, size = 10, prob = .50)

rbinom(n = 1, size = 100, prob = .50)
rbinom(n = 1, size = 100, prob = .50)

# Now we can also repeat running 10 trials and counting successes, e.g.
#   5 times count the number of successes in 10 trials
rbinom(n = 5, size = 10, prob = .50)
#   50 times count the number of successes in 100 trials 
rbinom(n = 50, size = 100, prob = .50)
# Run 10000 times and plot (I prefer the hist() function for quick histograms)
rbinom(n = 10000, size = 100, prob = .50) |> 
  hist()


# Our 'best friend' is the normal distribution
rnorm(n=1, mean = 100, sd = 15)
rnorm(n=1, mean = 100, sd = 15)

# And just like rbinom we can easily draw numbers many times 
rnorm(n=1000, mean = 100, sd = 15) |> 
  hist()

# Here is the Poisson distribution
rpois(n = 10, lambda = 3)
rpois(n = 10, lambda = 8)

# negative binomial distribution
rnbinom(n = 1,  size = 1, mu = 5)

# So if the expression we give to replicate returns a vector, replicate returns 
#   a matrix in which the columns represent the replications and the columns
#   the vector elements

# OOPS, what is this? 
# replicate accepts any valid expression, so when I type 'make_normal' 
#   without parentheses (brackets) is does not interpret it as 
#   a function but as a function definition, repeating it 5 times
#   and storing it in a list

# I should have typed:

# EXERCISE 5.1
# Discrete probability simulation: Suppose that a basketball player has a 60% chance of making

# (a) Write an R function to simulate this process.
# Assume: The function should return the numbers of shots taken, including the
#         two last ones that were missed
# The function takes one argument: the probability of making a shot

# EXERCISE 5.3 Binomial distribution: 
# A player takes 10 basketball shots, with a 40% probability of making

# (a) Write a line of R code to compute the probability that the player makes exactly 3 of the 10
