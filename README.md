# NSC-R reading group

This is a repository for the [NSC-R](https://nscrweb.netlify.app/) reading group on [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/index.html).

You can contribute your own scripts (complete, incomplete, whatever) to the **scripts/contributors** subfolder.

You can view the scripts created by the session chair in the **scripts/chair** subfolder.

The data for the whole book can be downloaded [here](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/examples.html#Download_code_and_data) (not a direct download link) and placed in the **data** folder.

Another way to get the data for the book is to install the corresponding R package  [rosdata](https://github.com/avehtari/ROS-Examples/blob/master/README.md).
